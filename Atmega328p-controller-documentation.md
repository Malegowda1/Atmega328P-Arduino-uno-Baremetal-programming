This repository provides a detailed explination of the ATmega328P microcontroller, a widely used 8-bit AVR device known 
for its reliability and versatility in embedded systems. Here, you'll find comprehensive explanations for Controller 
Architecture, Memory layout and each major feature of the controller including digital I/O ports,Timers, PWM, ADC, UART,SPI, I2C.  
**1.Controller Architecture**

This block diagram shows the major functional blocks and I/O of the ATmega328P microcontroller. It highlights the CPU and memory (Flash, SRAM, EEPROM), the system bus, clock and reset circuitry, and the main peripherals used in baremetal programming: timers/counters, PWM outputs, the 10-bit ADC, serial interfaces (UART, SPI, I2C/TWI), and general-purpose I/O ports (PORTB, PORTC, PORTD).  
**1.CPU & memory**
Program code lives in Flash; variables in SRAM; retained data in EEPROM. Keep stack usage and RAM usage minimal in embedded systems  
**2.System clock & reset**
The oscillator and clock prescalers determine peripheral and CPU timing. Watchdog and reset sources can restart the MCU â€” handle resets and watchdog behavior in initialization code.  
**3.Power & analog reference**
AVcc and AREF are used by the ADC; connect AVcc to Vcc (through a filter) and add decoupling caps. Do not forget AREF when doing accurate ADC reads.  
**4.I/O ports**
Each pin is controlled by DDRx (direction), PORTx (output/pull-up), and PINx (input read). Configure unused pins to avoid floating inputs.  
**5.Timers & PWM**
Timers provide delays, input capture, counters, and PWM generation. Use 8-bit timers for simple timing and 16-bit Timer1 for higher resolution or long intervals  
**6.ADC**
10-bit ADC with multiple channels. Choose a stable reference (AVcc, internal, or AREF) and use the recommended ADC prescaler for the required sampling speed and accuracy.  
**7.UART, SPI, I2C (TWI)**
UART: asynchronous serial for consoles and USB-to-serial modules. Use interrupts or DMA-like buffering for reliable comms.
SPI: high-speed synchronous master/slave bus (full duplex). Use the SS pin to select slaves and match clock polarity/phase.
I2C/TWI: multi-device two-wire bus requiring pull-up resistors on SDA/SCL; check status codes when implementing the master routines.  
**8.Interrupts**
External and peripheral interrupts enable responsive designs; keep ISR code short and hand off heavier work to the main loop.  
**Quick pin/function reference**
UART: RX = PD0, TX = PD1
SPI (hardware): MOSI = PB3(D11), MISO = PB4(D12), SCK = PB5(D13), SS = PB2(D10)
I2C / TWI: SDA = PC4(A4), SCL = PC5(A5)
ADC channels: ADC0..ADC5 = PC0..PC5 (10-bit)(A0 to A5)
External interrupts: INT0 = PD2(D2), INT1 = PD3(D3)
