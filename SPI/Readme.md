SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a high-speed synchronous serial communication protocol. It is widely used for interfacing with peripherals such as sensors, memory 
devices, and display modules. Unlike UART, SPI uses a shared clock signal to synchronize data transfer between the master and slave devices, making it faster and more 
reliable for short-distance communication.  
**SPI Pins on ATmega328P**  
1.MOSI (Master Out Slave In) → Pin PB3(D11)  
2.MISO (Master In Slave Out) → Pin PB4(D12)  
3.SCK (Serial Clock) → Pin PB5(D13)  
4.SS (Slave Select) → Pin PB2(D10)  
**Applications**  
1.Interfacing with EEPROM, SD cards, sensors, and displays.
